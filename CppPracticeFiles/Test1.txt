This test file is created to verify the CompareFiles.cpp program functionality. 
This program will compare both the test1.txt and test2.txt and output the different character if any.
Following text is just for example and taken from internet. 

"In the past, memory was extremely expensive, and computers did not have much of it. 
Consequently, there were incentives to make use of every bit of memory available. 
Consider the bool data type -- even though it only has two possible values (true and false), 
which can be represented by a single bit, it takes up an entire byte of memory! 
This is because variables need unique addresses, and memory can only be addressed in bytes. 
The bool uses 1 bit and the other 7 go to waste.Using bitwise operators, it is possible 
to write functions that allow us to compact 8 booleans into a single byte-sized variable, 
enabling significant memory savings at the expense of more complex code. In the past, 
this was a good trade-off. Today, at least for application programming, it is probably not."
